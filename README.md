# Elm Tutorial Example Solutions

This repository contains my example solutions for the exercises found at https://guide.elm-lang.org/.

## How to Use This Repo

I think this repo is best served as a helpful reference for those going through the official Elm tutorial themselves and are in need of some pointers from some fully implemented examples. That said, you might want to try the exercises yourself first and then look at this repo if you get stuck or are unsure of whether you are you are on the right track.

To actually run the examples, clone this repo locally to your machine, `cd` into the project root directory, run `elm reactor`, and then navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser to run each of the examples.

## Feedback

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions on making this repo more useful for those of you learning Elm and for those of you who may be more familiar with Elm best practices, don't hesitate to open up an issue.
